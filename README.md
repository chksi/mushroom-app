# Mushroom App - Setup & Code Organization

In this tutorial we will setup three containers:
* api-service
* data-collector
* frontend-simple

The following container architecture is what we will implement:

![Docker setup for Mushroom App](https://storage.googleapis.com/public_colab_images/docker/docker_containers_mushroom_app2.png)

## Prerequisites
* Have Docker installed
* Cloned this repository to your local machine with a terminal up and running
* Check that your Docker is running with the following command

`docker run hello-world`

### Install Docker 
Install `Docker Desktop`

#### Ensure Docker Memory
- To make sure we can run multiple container go to Docker>Preferences>Resources and in "Memory" make sure you have selected > 4GB

### Install VSCode  
Follow the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your operating system.  
If you already have a preferred text editor, skip this step.  

### Make sure we do not have any running containers and clear up an unused images
* Run `docker container ls`
* Stop any container that is running
* Run `docker system prune`
* Run `docker image ls`

## Create project folders
- Create a root project folder `mushroom-app`
- Organize containers into sub folders, create the following folders inside the project folder:
    * `api-service`
    * `data-collector`
    * `frontend-simple`

- Create a folder called `persistent-folder` inside the root project folder
- Create a folder called `secrets` inside the root project folder
- Add a `.gitignore` file at the root project folder. 

### **We do not want to push the content in `persistent-folder` and `secrets` to GitHUb**

`.gitignore`
```
/persistent-folder
/secrets
```

## Frontend App (Simple) Container
We will create a simple frontend app that uses basic HTML & Javascript. 

### Go into the frontend-simple folder 
- Open a terminal and go to the location where `mushroom-app/frontend-simple`

### Add a `Dockerfile`
Start with a base docker container with and add the following:
- Use a base image slim version fo Debian with node installed
- Ensure we have an up to date baseline, install dependencies
- Install `http-server`
- Create a user so we don't run the app as root, add a user called `app`
- Create a directory `app`, where we will place all our code
- Set the owner of the directory as the newly created user
- Expose port `8080` from the container to the outside for the web server
- Switch the user to `app` and set the the working directory to `app`

`Dockerfile`
```
FROM node:14.9.0-buster-slim

# Update baseline and ensure we don't run the app as root.
RUN set -ex; \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get upgrade -y && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssl && \
    npm install -g http-server && \
    useradd -ms /bin/bash app -d /home/app -G sudo -u 2000 -p "$(openssl passwd -1 Passw0rd)" && \
    mkdir -p /app && \
    chown app:app /app

EXPOSE 8080

# Switch to the new user
USER app
WORKDIR /app

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
```
### Add a `docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat`
Based on your OS, create a startup script to make building & running the container easy

`docker-shell.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

# exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status
set -e

# Define some environment variables
# Automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands
# source: the command 'help export' run in Terminal
export IMAGE_NAME="mushroom-app-frontend-simple"
export BASE_DIR=$(pwd)

# Build the image based on the Dockerfile
docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME -f Dockerfile .

# Create the container
# --mount: Attach a filesystem mount to the container
# -p: Publish a container's port(s) to the host (host_port: container_port) (source: https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/intermediate/networking/ExposingContainerPort.html)
docker run --rm --name $IMAGE_NAME -ti \
--mount type=bind,source="$BASE_DIR",target=/app \
-p 8080:8080 $IMAGE_NAME
```


`docker-shell.bat`
```
REM Define some environment variables
SET IMAGE_NAME=frontend-app
SET BASE_DIR=%cd%

REM Build the image based on the Dockerfile
docker build -t %IMAGE_NAME% -f Dockerfile .

REM Create the container
REM --mount: Attach a filesystem mount to the container
REM -p: Publish a container's port(s) to the host (host_port: container_port) (source: https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/intermediate/networking/ExposingContainerPort.html)
docker run  --rm --name %IMAGE_NAME% -ti --mount type=bind,source="%cd%",target=/app -p 8080:8080 %IMAGE_NAME%
```

### Add a App home page

`index.html`
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>üçÑ Mushroom Identifier</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        Welcome to the mushroom identification App!
    </body>
</html>
```

### Build & Run Container
- Run `sh docker-shell.sh` or `docker-shell.bat` for windows

### Start Web Server
- To run development web server run `http-server` from the docker shell
- Test the web app by going to `http://localhost:8080/`


## Backend API Container
We will create a basic backend container to run our REST API. The FastAPI framework will be used for this.

### Go into the api-service folder 
- Open a terminal and go to the location where `mushroom-app/api-service`


## Data Collector Container
We will create a python container that can run scripts from the CLI. This can be used to run scripts to download images from Google

### Go into the data-collector folder 
- Open a terminal and go to the location where `mushroom-app/data-collector`
