# Mushroom App - APIs & Frontend App

In this tutorial add on more functionality to the following containers:
* api-service
* frontend-simple

The following container architecture is what we have built so far:

## Prerequisites

### Ensure containers are running
- Ensure `database-server` is running
- Ensure `api-service` is running and accessible at `http://localhost:9000/`. Run `uvicorn_server` to make sure API Service is running.
- Ensure `frontend-simple` is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`. Run `http-server` to make sure web server is running.

## Create API for the leaderboard list

In this section we will query the database for the leaderboard and return it to the API as a list of json objects

### First we will create a data access method
- In the `api-service` folder under dataaccess create a new python file `leaderboard.py`
- Add the following code block

`leaderboard.py`
```

```

### Create an API route to expose return the leaderboard data
- Modify `service.py` to call this database method to get the leaderboard data
- Add the following import in `service.py`

`service.py`
```
from dataaccess import leaderboard
```

- At the bottom of `service.py` add the following new route

`service.py`
```
@app.get("/leaderboard")
async def get_leaderboard():
    return leaderboard.browse()
```

- You can access this new route from the browser at 'http://localhost:9000/leaderboard'

ðŸŽ‰ What did we just do? 
* We read some data from a table in a **PostgreSQL** container. Converted the data to list of dictionary objects in **Python** and exposed the results as a REST API using **FastAPI**
